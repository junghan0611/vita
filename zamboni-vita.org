* Instructions :noexport:

If you are viewing this file on Gitlab or Github, a lot of the document below may not make a lot of sense. Much of the metadata (e.g. job dates, companies, etc.) are encoded in Org-mode heading properties, which are processed by the [[https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/org-cv/-/tree/awesomecv][ox-awesomecv]] exporter to produce the LaTeX document. See the raw source of this file to see the full information.

* How to include private information in the CV :noexport:

The "Private info" section below contains private information which is not included in the CV by default. It is kept encrypted automatically thanks to the =org-crypt= package. The "crypt" tag causes it to be encrypted automatically every time the file is saved, and the "noexport" tag of the header above causes it to be omitted when the file gets exported. Its contents, when unencrypted, contains field definitions like this:

#+begin_src org
,#+mobile: <my mobile number>
,#+address: <my address>
,#+extrainfo: <other private information>
#+end_src

When encrypted, this information is simply ignored. When I want to produce a version of my CV which includes this information, I run ~M-x org-decrypt-entry~, which prompts for my GPG passphrase. Then, *without saving the file*, I run the following export command:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-export-to-file 'awesomecv "zamboni-vita-private.tex")
#+end_src

- Billy Goat was the first instance of what is today called /honeypots/ and /honeynets/.
  + An active worm-detection system, widely deployed (at the time) in the IBM worldwide internal network. It listens for connections to unused IP address ranges and actively responds to those connections to accurately detect worm-infected machines, and in many cases capture the worms themselves. Billy Goat is engineered for distributed deployment, with each device containing standalone detection and reporting capabilities, together with data centralization features that allow network-wide data analysis and reporting.

- An active worm-capture device deployed at the network boundary and coupled with the border router, that allows the Billy Goat to effectively and automatically spoof every unused IP address outside the local network. This makes it possible for the Router-based Billy Goat to accurately detect local infected machines and prevent them from establishing connections to the outside, limiting the propagation of the worms to the outside network.
